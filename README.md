Breadboard Power Supply with USB data line pass-through

I started this small project because out of all of the similar type products out there not one has USB data line pass-through. Maybe it is because I am mostly interested in making PC peripherals but I am somewhat surprised that there is nothing out there already that has the feature set I am looking for.

Features I am looking for in a breadboard power supply…

   * Independently selectable 3.3V and 5V for two power bars.
   * Optional shutdown of a single power bar.
   * Provide power from both a wall wart or a USB connection.
   * ESD protection. (I think I went a bit over board on this front)
   * USB data line pass-through
   * Stable. Won't floop around.

A good potion of this design is straight from my <a href="http://chris.majoros.us/mmdh/?page_id=141">loststone</a> project.

More information can be round on the <a href="http://chris.majoros.us/mmdh/?page_id=392">project page</a>.
